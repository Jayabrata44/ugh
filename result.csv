In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office.

Postman's features simplify each step of building an API & streamline collaboration to help create better APIs—faster. More than 35 million developers & 500,000 organizations worldwide use Postman today, and we continue to strive humbly towards our mission of 100 million connected developers & serving companies as they seek to innovate in an API-first world. Our customers are doing more and more astounding things with the Postman product every day, and as a result, we are growing rapidly.
We highly recommend reading The ""API-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture & our vision at Postman.
About the team & role:
The “Automation Testing” team at Postman is responsible for a set of products designed to help users test their APIs, manually and otherwise. This means there are a wide range of problems to solve – from a globally distributed system capable of executing hundreds of thousands of collections, to a browser-based client capable of running hours-long jobs, to CLI tools used to test production-grade APIs. The team primarily operates in an asynchronous manner, leveraging tools like Slack, Jira, and Confluence to stay on the same page. There is usually only one recurring meeting for the team every week, though team members can choose to work synchronously when appropriate.
Engineers on the team are encouraged to operate across the stack instead of siloing themselves into “frontend-only” or “backend-only” modes of operation. Folks do tend to specialize in whatever they find interesting, but are perfectly capable of building quality products by themselves as well. Everyone is expected to understand that, while part of the job is to write code, their actual responsibility is to build a great product and experience. This entails working hand-in-hand with everyone outside of Engineering, taking ownership of the product and experience as a whole.
Day-to-day work:

This is a hybrid role where you’re expected to work out of Postman’s Bangalore office three days a week – Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The team is distributed across three timezones, however, and the working model is an asynchronous, remote-first model.

Folks have a fair amount of control over their work schedule and tend to start and end their days at different times. This also means that a rigid sprint/scrum/agile model with daily stand-ups doesn’t work well – so we’ve adopted a more flexible model. In simple terms, everyone starts their day with the next milestone in mind, gets a sense of what the rest of the team is aiming to achieve, and figures out what they can contribute.

There’s a lot of written work that happens – engineering specifications, implementation documents, and, of course, pull requests. Most of the time in a day will likely be spent on technical design, discussion, and writing. Coding tends to be the fastest and easiest part, since it happens once everyone has a clear enough idea of what to write.

Part of the day goes towards engaging with users on platforms like Github or Discourse. This could be as simple as answering basic questions users might have, or addressing specific issues and pushing bug fixes. These interactions tend to inform the decisions we make as a team, so these are important!

While we engineer solutions to the best of our abilities, it’s inevitable that things go wrong once in a while. Participating in the on-call rotation is an important part of everyone’s role, and tends to take up 2 weeks every two months or so, with one week as the secondary on-call and another week as the primary.

About You:

At least 3 years of professional experience in the field. This is not an entry level role and you’re expected to have mastery over the basic operational aspects of software engineering, along with some exposure to building and maintaining production-grade products. There are no strict language or framework requirements, but you will have to get familiar with Javascript, React, Node.js, and adjacent tech to succeed in this role. Of course, you’ll have a whole team helping you learn, so this shouldn’t be a huge concern.

Familiarity across the stack, or an enthusiastic attitude to fill in your knowledge gaps. The team is already capable of building great products without being siloed into “frontend”, “backend”, etc. roles, and the expectation remains the same for this role.

You have empathy for the end users and your teammates (living things in general, really). This reflects in how usable your product is, how you write your code, and how you work with others.",78,The years of experience required for this job are 3.,3.0

Job title: Advanced Embedded System Engineer

Job Type: Full time, Work from office

Location : Bangalore

Years of Experience : 4+yrs

Salary : 120k- 200k/M

Advanced Embedded System Engineering with AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) and MATLAB involves designing and developing complex automotive systems using the AUTOSAR standard and MATLAB/Simulink software. AUTOSAR is a standardized architecture for automotive software development, aiming to enhance the scalability, reusability, and interoperability of software components in automotive systems.

Here are some key aspects and tools involved in advanced embedded system engineering with AUTOSAR and MATLAB:
• AUTOSAR Architecture: AUTOSAR defines a layered software architecture for automotive systems, consisting of application software, basic software, and runtime environment. It provides a standardized methodology for software component design, communication, and integration.
• AUTOSAR Component Development: MATLAB/Simulink is commonly used for designing AUTOSAR software components. Using Simulink, you can create functional models of the components, define their behavior, and generate the corresponding C code. Simulink also provides verification and validation capabilities for ensuring the correctness of the component's behavior.
• System Description and Modeling: MATLAB/Simulink allows you to create system-level models of the entire embedded system. These models can include both software and hardware components, as well as their interactions and communication interfaces. The system models can be used for system-level analysis, simulation, and optimization.
• AUTOSAR Configuration: AUTOSAR configuration tools, such as the AUTOSAR authoring tool (AUTOSAR Builder) or the SystemDesk tool, are used to configure and integrate AUTOSAR software components. These tools enable the mapping of the system-level models to AUTOSAR-specific representations and generate the necessary configuration files.
• Code Generation: MATLAB/Simulink provides code generation capabilities that allow you to generate AUTOSAR-compliant C code from the system models and software component models. The generated code can be integrated with the AUTOSAR runtime environment and basic software modules.
• Integration and Testing: After code generation, the generated software components need to be integrated with the AUTOSAR runtime environment and other basic software modules. Integration testing ensures the correct behavior of the integrated system and the interactions between different components.
• Verification and Validation: MATLAB/Simulink provides various verification and validation techniques, such as model checking, simulation-based testing, and formal verification, to ensure the correctness and reliability of the embedded system. These techniques help identify and fix potential issues early in the development cycle.
• Debugging and Optimization: MATLAB/Simulink provides debugging tools and capabilities for analyzing the behavior of the embedded system during runtime. Additionally, you can use MATLAB's optimization capabilities to optimize the system's performance, power consumption, or other desired metrics.

By combining the power of AUTOSAR and MATLAB/Simulink, engineers can design, develop, and test complex embedded systems for the automotive domain more efficiently. These tools facilitate the modularization, reusability, and scalability of software components, ensuring the development of high-quality, reliable, and maintainable automotive systems.",146,The years of experience required for this job is 4+yrs.,4.0

CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.  

here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.

how is life at CRED?  

working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED, people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.  

hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in\\\\\\\\-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves, and a comprehensive health insurance.  

to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.

CRED is an exclusive community for India’s most trustworthy and creditworthy individuals, where the members are rewarded for good financial behavior. CRED was born out of a need to bring back the focus on a long lost virtue, one of trust, the idea being to create a community centered around this virtue. a community that constantly strives to become more virtuous in this regard till they finally scale their behavior to create a utopia where being trustworthy is the norm and not the exception. to build a community like this requires a community of its own; a community special in its own way, working towards making this vision come true.  

here’s a thought experiment: what do you get when you put a group of incredibly passionate and driven people and entrust them with the complete freedom to chase down their goals in a completely uninhibited manner? answer: you get something close to what we have at CRED; CRED just has it better.

how is life at CRED?  

working at CRED would instantly make you realize one thing: you are working with the best talent around you. not just in the role you occupy, but everywhere you go. talk to someone around you; most likely you will be talking to a singer, standup comic, artist, writer, an athlete, maybe a magician. at CRED, people always have talent up their sleeves. with the right company, even conversations can be rejuvenating. at CRED, we guarantee a good company.  

hard truths: pushing oneself comes with the role. and we realise pushing oneself is hard work. which is why CRED is in the continuous process of building an environment that helps the team rejuvenate oneself: included but not limited to a stacked, in\\\\\\\\-house pantry, with lunch and dinner provided for all the team members, paid sick leaves, and a comprehensive health insurance.  

to make things smoother and to make sure you spend time and energy only on the most important things, CRED strives to make every process transparent: there are no work timings because we do not believe in archaic methods of calculating productivity, your work should speak for you. there are no job designations because you will be expected to hold down roles that cannot be described in one word. since trust is a major virtue in the community we have built, we make it a point to highlight it in the community behind CRED: all our employees get their salaries before their joining date. a show of trust that speaks volumes because of the skin in the game.

This means there are a wide range of problems to solve – from a globally distributed system capable of executing hundreds of thousands of collections, to a browser-based client capable of running hours-long jobs, to CLI tools used to test production-grade APIs. The team primarily operates in an asynchronous manner, leveraging tools like Slack, Jira, and Confluence to stay on the same page. There is usually only one recurring meeting for the team every week, though team members can choose to work synchronously when appropriate.
Engineers on the team are encouraged to operate across the stack instead of siloing themselves into “frontend-only” or “backend-only” modes of operation. Folks do tend to specialize in whatever they find interesting, but are perfectly capable of building quality products by themselves as well. Everyone is expected to understand that, while part of the job is to write code, their actual responsibility is to build a great product and experience. This entails working hand-in-hand with everyone outside of Engineering, taking ownership of the product and experience as a whole.
Day-to-day work:

This is a hybrid role where you’re expected to work out of Postman’s Bangalore office three days a week – Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The team is distributed across three timezones, however, and the working model is an asynchronous, remote-first model.

Folks have a fair amount of control over their work schedule and tend to start and end their days at different times. This also means that a rigid sprint/scrum/agile model with daily stand-ups doesn’t work well – so we’ve adopted a more flexible model. In simple terms, everyone starts their day with the next milestone in mind, gets a sense of what the rest of the team is aiming to achieve, and figures out what they can contribute.

There’s a lot of written work that happens – engineering specifications, implementation documents, and, of course, pull requests. Most of the time in a day will likely be spent on technical design, discussion, and writing. Coding tends to be the fastest and easiest part, since it happens once everyone has a clear enough idea of what to write.

Part of the day goes towards engaging with users on platforms like Github or Discourse. This could be as simple as answering basic questions users might have, or addressing specific issues and pushing bug fixes. These interactions tend to inform the decisions we make as a team, so these are important!

While we engineer solutions to the best of our abilities, it’s inevitable that things go wrong once in a while. Participating in the on-call rotation is an important part of everyone’s role, and tends to take up 2 weeks every two months or so, with one week as the secondary on-call and another week as the primary.

About You:

At least 3 years of professional experience in the field. This is not an entry level role and you’re expected to have mastery over the basic operational aspects of software engineering, along with some exposure to building and maintaining production-grade products. There are no strict language or framework requirements, but you will have to get familiar with Javascript, React, Node.js, and adjacent tech to succeed in this role. Of course, you’ll have a whole team helping you learn, so this shouldn’t be a huge concern.

Familiarity across the stack, or an enthusiastic attitude to fill in your knowledge gaps. The team is already capable of building great products without being siloed into “frontend”, “backend”, etc. roles, and the expectation remains the same for this role.

About Us:

We're solving a problem that 62% of Americans have

62% of Americans last year thought about starting a business. The #1 reason they didn’t was because they didn’t know where to start. Currents options are:
• Going independent which is risky: no support or direction
• Paying a franchise which is expensive: franchises charge $100K+ fees to get started, take 10% of topline revenue, don't provide marketing support or technology

The market we're going after is bigger than e-Commerce

We’re disrupting the $2.3T franchise industry by removing the franchise fee and offering a tech-enabled franchise like product.

We’re starting with home painting where our biggest competitor is CertaPro a $550M revenue franchise (1% market share) before quickly taking on Neighborly Brands as we expand categories (pest control, lawn care, etc.).

As we expand categories, our customer does not change

Our customer is an aspiring business owner, like Nick or Hardin who doesn't care what type of business they start, as long as it is profitable. Our customers are not actually the one painting houses or completing roofing jobs, rather they are the one that hires people to do the job. Our customer has years of experience in sales and general management, which makes them suitable for any type of business — which is why as we expand to 100 categories, our customer does not change.

Our solution is an end to end platform to help you start, grow and run a business

Main Street is a combination of well-known technology platforms that provides an Uber-like simple experience in starting a business
• Stripe Atlas: Helping you incorporate and set up legal logistics for your business
• Duolingo: Learn a new skill (in our case it is about a specific type of business)
• Shopify: The operating tools to run your business
• Womply: A marketing stack to drive your customer

We're backed by top investors and built a world-class team

We're a seed-stage startup and have raised $10M+ from top investors including Greylock and Khosla.
