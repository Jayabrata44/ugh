We are a seed funded SaaS startup helping e-commerce brands on Shopify move away from boring, impersonal marketing emails and sell on chat apps like FB Messenger & Whatsapp.

Within a year of launch, we have 1200+ e-commerce brands across 50+ countries using our product (pretty cool right?).

Check us out here - https://apps.shopify.com/bitespeed-fb-messenger-chatbot and do read through the 150 odd 5-star reviews to get a sense of what our customers say about us (we openly brag about this 😉).

About Us - We are a bunch of BITS Pilani graduates that started BiteSpeed out of our dorm rooms. When we started we hardly knew much about running a company, in fact most of us hadn’t written a line of code in our lives.

We were inspired by companies like Postman and Freshworks which have built market leading software companies from India and had a desire to create something world-class which we could be proud of.

So we jumped off the cliff and built a parachute on our way down (just as Reid Hoffman likes to say).

We could make a long, boring list of 20 company values but by now you probably do get a gist of the kind of people we are. We are young, ambitious self-learners on a journey to create a globally competitive software company from India.

About the role - We’re looking for a full-stack developer to join our founding team and lead our product development. If you’re someone who thrives on high ownership, can figure stuff out on your own and wants to be part of the zero-to-one journey, this might be for you.

What you’ll do:-

Tl;dr, we’re at 100k requests per day, you’ll take us to 10M requests per day.

As we’re still early at building a dedicated backend team, responsibilities will have breadth over a lot of cool stuff 🙌
• Looking out for cool new technologies and implementing them for required internal as well as business use cases
• Designing scalable architectures for backend systems
• Optimizing performance of applications for full scale production deployments
• Implementing business logic and developing APIs and services.
• Conceptualizing and implementing scalable databases across various services
• You’ll be hiring and mentoring junior developers

What makes you a good fit:-
• If you can write code that works, we should be good but read on (disclaimer: most of what follows is not a hard requirement);
• You have 2+ years of experience building and scaling backend systems from scratch;
• You've built serverless backend architectures using AWS platform and resources like Lambda, DynamoDB, Aurora, etc. (Brownie points if you’ve worked with NodeJS,Redis and Postgres);
• You have managed deployment at scale using CI/CD integrations and implemented error management systems like Sentry;
• Most of the above is us trying to sound legit about our stack, so if you’ve not worked with some of it & are open to learning or have better ideas, it’s totally cool;
• Be ready to jam to this every time we push to prod - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9QNUcrjtOs;

If what we’re up to sounds interesting, do apply!

Know someone who might be a great fit? Refer them to us, if they end up joining and complete 3 months with us, we'll send you an Amazon Echo Dot as a gesture of thanks!
